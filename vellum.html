            <p>
                A common requirement among New York City Art and Design colleges is
                that the first year is dedicated to fine art fundamentals, regardless
                of their major. Students are required to either buy or pay extra for
                an assortment of paper, tools, and other materials, which is
                convenient, but they often go unused beyond this initial year.
            </p>
            <br /><br>

            <br /><br />
            <p>
                A stronger indicator of this was when the Instagram account
                @frugaliciousmamas took it upon themselves to try collecting all the
                Parsons first year kit leftovers from one of the dorms, and there was
                so many materials that they couldn't even transport the materials to
                the donating center they wanted to use.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Much of the art supplies they ended up collecting are still in
                @frugaliciousmamas's apartment, and it requires much communication in
                order to distribute all of them. Outside of this first year program,
                we have had first had experience with extra art supplies as well.

                <div class="quote">
                    <p>So we asked:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        What can we do about the overwhelming amount of art supplies left each year?

            </div>

            <p>After identifying our problem, we wanted to learn the scope of our issue by conducting surveys with many
                different art students.</p>
            <p>We did this through Google Forms, and shared it in various online communities to get a diverse amount of
                input; Our questions came from a preliminary interview that we had with @frugaliciousmamas.</p><br>

            <div class="quote">
                <blockquote>
                    In total, there were 45 responses from 4 different NYC Art schools.
                </blockquote>
            </div>

            <p>After our survey, we went into interviews to talk 1 on 1 with 7 students from different schools and
                majors to better understand the NYC art student experience. <br><br>
                Through these interviews we learned that:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li class="numbered">Students want security when meeting up with another student, especially in NYC</li>
                <li class="numbered">Students want a sense of community</li>
                <li class="numbered">Students want their experience to feel personalized</li>

                    <h6>PROBLEM</h6>
                    <blockquote>
                        There is a lack of a centralized platform for NYC art students to easily buy, sell, or donate
                        art
                        supplies, resulting in inefficient disposal methods and wastage of reusable materials.

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Creating a platform for students to trade, buy, and sell art supplies will reduce the amount of unused
                materials in students on and off-campus accommodations, thereby decreasing spatial congestion as
                measured by reduced storage space usage.</p><br>
            <div class="spacing">

                <h6>PROJECT GOALS</h6>
                <p>The Hypothesis statement guided our design choices to ensure that we attained the goals that we had
                    initially set when embarking this case study: </p><br>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li class="numbered">To create a mobile app that improves and "revolutionizes" the art supply buying
                        experience for the everyday art student.</li>
                    <li class="numbered">Make the platform peer 2 peer and by doing so, strengthen and build the art and
                        design community in New York City.</li>
                    <li class="numbered">Promote sustainability and reduce wastage of art supplies within the city.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>We synthesized our user research findings using an Empathy Map to identify common patterns and
                    insights.
                    This tool enabled us to align our design strategy with the users' experiences, capturing what they
                    see,
                    hear, do, think, and feel. It was instrumental in pinpointing pain points and opportunities for
                    enhancing their experience as well as directing our user personas. </p><br>
            </div>

            <figure>

            <div class="spacing">
                <p>Based on our Empathy Mapping, surveys, and interviews, we were able to summarize our findings into
                    three distinct user personas. Each persona embodies the collective goals, frustrations, and needs
                    observed across our user base, providing a focused lens for our user research decisions.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We learned from our interviews that one of the primary issues is the first year kits, hence our
                    main/primary user persona is that of a First Year Student (<em>BUY</em> persona).</p>
                <p>The next would be the undergrad students who no longer require their existing supplies (<em>SELL</em>
                    persona).</p>
                <p>Additionally, we wanted to consider the alumni who would want to clear out their apartment but not
                    want to throw away their supplies (<em>DONATE</em> persona).</p>
                <br>
                <p>All students wanted a sense of community as well as promoting sustainability within their student
                    circles.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>Our app seemed to have a lot of similarities with other apps, two main contenders being Facebook
                Marketplace and Depop.</p>

            <div class="quote">
                <blockquote>

                    To understand how we could differentiate our product and improve the current landscape, we chose to
                    do a SWOT analysis of these contenders. </blockquote>

            </figure>

            <p>Our analysis concluded that enhancing user privacy and security is critical, addressing the deficiencies
                in existing apps' handling of sensitive information. Additionally, we will integrate a
                community-validated verification process to reinforce seller credibility and trust.</p>

            <p>From our swot analysis this is the user flow that seems to be common- it’s hard to find a specific art
                supply, you may not be chosen to receive a product.</p>

                <p>The data collected during the Competitive Analysis process was used to create detailed information

                    we looked back on our past takeaways. </p><br>
                <p> Our user personas represent a student who would primarily buy, another who sells, and another who
                    wants community. By following these 3 flows, we created a cleaner base for our information

                <p>Now is where we began the fun part of bringing our research to life by designing! Starting off by
                    simply sketching our ideas, to then moving onto Figma for wireframing. Much of our initial layouts
                    for the wireframes were inspired by user flows from our competitors' applications. </p><br>

                            To aid our design choices, we conducted preliminary user tests on our peers, asking them to

                            uncomfortable or unintuitive. <br>Some peers said that they wanted icons on the bottom of
                            the
                            screens while others did not like this. Some liked having a (navigational) menu tab to keep
                            things hidden until clicked, but that extra click felt a little uncomfortable to others.

                    <p>We used our branding to polish our low fidelity prototype and tested it out with potential users.
                    </p>
                    <p>We received a lot of great criticism, with some key points being:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="numbered">Including a search bar when choosing your address instead of having to zoom
                            into your location on the map</li>
                        <li class="numbered">consistency with buttons</li>
                        <li class="numbered">making sure that you can add the price to a new listing.</li>
                    <ul>
                </blockquote>

                <div class="spacing">
                    <p>But, the biggest issue we had through all of this was,</p>
                    <div class="quote">
                        <blockquote>
                            What would you do if you were an alumni?</blockquote>
                    </div>
                    <p>We had based our security off of .edu emails, which is the way that you would sign up and sign in
                        to
                        the app.

                        <br>But we didn't have a feature in the app that would accommodate for students who had an
                        email,
                        but lost it after they graduated.
                    </p>
                    <p>So, we redid our login screen and rearranged it to have an option to apply as a current
                        non-student
                        user like an alumni. Alumni may be a great resource for art supplies, especially those who used
                        to
                        be art students and decided not to go into the field.</p>

                <h6>REFLECTION</h6>
                <p>This was our first official case study,  so we learned a lot! Here were our key takeaways:</p>
                <ol type="0">
                    <li class="numbered">We realized how important user research is in the design process and to fully process the takeaways, it's helpful to look back at the surveys, and interviews that you've done to stay focused.</li>
                    <li class="numbered">Final user testing is really important, and many changes may come as a result. For example, we realized towards the end that if we don't have a package  delivery system in our app, the checkout feature would be irrelevant, so we changed it to “bag.” As in to “bag” an item. </li>
                    <li class="numbered">Users may change their minds a lot when seeing the low fidelity vs final prototype. It's good to be prepared for these big changes, and not be too attached to the features.</li>

                <h4 class="bold">STARTING WITH A GENERALIZED INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h4>
                <p>Since this was our first Case Study, our initial Information Architecture (which we derived from our competitive market analysis) was extremely comprehensive and time-consuming, when it could have been simplified/generalized. <br>This would have saved us some time and effort before creating our final app structure. </p>
                <br><br><h4 class="bold">FREQUENTLY CHECKING BACK AT THE TAKEAWAYS</h4>
                <p>There have been instances where we would have to backtrack a lot as we cross-referenced only a few aspects of our research to guide our design-decisions. <br>Organizing all of our data through an affinity map may have helped us utilize all of the data we collected in a holistic manner.</p>
